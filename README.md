# Elevator-Simulation
Three Elevator Simulations


This project implements three elevator simulations in Python. The first one is Random, the second is Strategic , and then third is the Optimal algorithm. The first program compares the Random and Strategy Elevators. The second one compares the Strategy and the Optimal Elevator. Let's see which algorithm wins and by how much.  


honors1V2.py (Random vs. Strategy Elevator)
This project compares two algorithms for an efficient elevator. In the two simulations, each algorithm attempts to deliver passengers as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Both simulations report their movements to a file, single_run.txt. Statistics are reported to another file, multiple_run.txt. Graphical results are displayed in the python shell.

honors2.py (Strategy vs. Optimal Elevator)

The Optiomal elevator attempts to beat the strategy elevator by implementing an algorithm that reduces passenger average wait time.
