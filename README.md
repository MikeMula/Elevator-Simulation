Three Elevator Simulations


This project implements three elevator simulations in Python. The first one is Random, the second is Strategic , and then third is the Optimal algorithm. The first program compares the Random and Strategy Elevators. The second one compares the Strategy and the Optimal Elevator. Let's see which algorithm wins and by how much.
